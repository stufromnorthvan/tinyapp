# ⚫️ ⚪️ 🟡 🔴 TinyApp: What Does It Do? 🔴 🟡 ⚪️ ⚫️

TinyApp is a full stack web app used to shorten web URLs. The URLs are put into the app in their long format and are given a shorted version of the URL that links to the corresponding webpage. TinyApp was built by Stu Mitchell of Tla'Amin Nation, using up to date versions of Node and Express.

Thank you for using TinyApp.
